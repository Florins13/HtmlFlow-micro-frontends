/**
 * Hot reload visitor that processes templates without preprocessing optimization. This visitor
 * recalculates the entire HTML on every rendering, making it suitable for development scenarios
 * where template changes need immediate reflection.
 *
 * <p><strong>Limitations:</strong>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Does not support async operations (visitAwait)
 *   <li>Does not support suspending operations (visitSuspending)
 *   <li>Performance is significantly slower than optimized visitor
 * </ul>
